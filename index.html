            <div>
                <p>I graduated high school then joined the military. When I finished, I went to college. Decided what I went to school for is not for me. I worked a dead end job until I learned about this course.</p>

            <div>
                <p>I really enjoy speding time with my wife and dog. I have a golden retriever named Jax who is 3 years old. My wife and I enjoy spending time together and taking Jax to breweries, the dog park, and relaxing around the house and watching football or any long running shows on Netflix.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Going to breweries.</li>
                    <li>Binge watching show on Netflix, HULU, or Amazon. (Whichever has the most seasons of the show available)</li>
                    <li>Relaxing around the house and grilling good food.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <p>I started watching tons of TV shows during my time in the military. When your on deployment there is really nothing else to do in your free time. I had over 100 Gb of tv shows that I would watch to help pass the time. It's a habbit that I have not been able to kick.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
                    <li>House</li>
